# Movie-recommendation-based-on-emotion

Description:
One of the underlying targets of movies is to evoke emotions in their viewers.
There are 8 classes of emotion that would be effective to classify a text. These are: ‘Anger’,
‘contempt’, ‘Fear’, ‘happy’, ‘Sad’, ‘Surprise’, ’love’, ’enjoyment’. Here these are taken as
input and the corresponding movies would be displayed for the emotion. The correspondence
of every emotion with genre of movies is listed below: Sad - Musical, contempt - Sports,
Anger -Family, Love-thriller, Fear – Romantic, Enjoyment – Horror, Surprise – Drama,
Happy-Family.

Based on the input emotion and the preferred language, the corresponding genre
would be selected and all the top 20 movies of that genre would be recommended to the user.
Movie lists are extracted from the IMDB website by using Web Scraping.
